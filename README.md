# Global-Earthquakes-Analytics
This github repository contains files with analytics performed solely using Tableau. The associated excel file contains data cleaned preliminarily prior to doing analytics in Tableau. Tableau files are best viewed using the Tableau desktop application or Tableau public.

In this project, I analysed earthquake data to explore trends and understand patterns of seismic activity around the world.

●	Exploring a data set to understand both the opportunities it presents as well as any limitations.  Making sensible, justifiable decisions about how best to proceed with analysis when working with imperfect data.
●	Creating a variety of visualisations to uncover insights
●	Utilising breakdowns, groups, sets, filtering, pages and calculated metrics (where/ if relevant) to enhance your visualisations and findings
●	Refining your visualisations to craft a clear and concise story for your audience
●	Bringing a variety of visualizations together in a dashboard and/or storypoints to convey a coherent narrative 

# Deliverables from this project
A series of visualisations displayed in either a dashboard or storypoints that conveys the findings relating to worldwide earthquakes.  
Also includes brief notes on any limitations or shortcomings of the data, assumptions, as well as recommended next steps for analysis and/or research.
Process
# Step One: Exploratory Analysis
-	I made a few high level visualisations and/or examined the raw data.
-	Consider: Could there be any pattern/s of inconsistency, inaccuracy or incompleteness within the data? Will these patterns have changed over time?  How can I adjust my approach to the analysis to account for this?
# Step Two: Creation of Visualisations
Create visualisations to show:
-	Location of earthquakes around the world
-	Total earthquakes over time (use a date range based on your judgement)
-	Significant earthquakes over time.  Include an editable slide filter for magnitude.
-	An overview of the share of earthquakes by their size and/ or impact
-	Any other visualisations of your choosing that provide an overview or insight into seismic activity.
# Step Three: Summary and Presentation
-	A selection of my key visualisations is put into a Tableau Dashboard or ‘Story’ and add appropriate commentary to explain my findings.
-	From what I know about earthquakes and the dataset, created hypotheses or theories to explain any patterns or findings I have uncovered
-	Created recommendations for further research and/or analysis
-	Noted any assumptions and/or limitations
-	Demonstrated how to utilize a calculated field to add value to the analysis.
