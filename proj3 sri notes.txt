Data is well-documented from 1900 to present.  Data is inconsistent for years between 1900 to 1500. And data is very lacking between Year 1500 to Year -2000,   meaning between years 1500AD and 2000BC. This is due to poor documentation, lack of universal standards in measuring every incident and recording the scale of magnitude, economic damage, area and associated events. 


Time earlier than Year 0  shows just major earthquake events of magnitude above 5.5. Improvement in data documentation for earthquake occurences can be seen from Year 0.  Data is more consistent from Year 2000. This is a direct result of technological advancements in record keepting, global communication and impact analysis.
